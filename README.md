A minimal `bitcoind` RPC client custom built for [BDK](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk).

## Features

- **Multiple Bitcoin Core Version Support**: implements support for multiple Bitcoin Core versions in the backend:
  - Bitcoin Core v30.0
  - Bitcoin Core v29.0
  - Bitcoin Core v28.0

- **Minimal Dependencies**: by default, the minimal `bitreq_http` is used as the HTTP transport.

- **Separation of Concerns**: focused on emitting generic data structures, such as blocks,
headers and mempool. Interpreting this data is left to wallets that use this crate as a chain-source.

- **Robust Error Handling**: implements specifc error variants for RPC, deserialization and transport errors.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml` manifest to use this crate with
the latest Bitcoin Core version (currently v30.0) as the backend:

```toml
bdk-bitcoind-client = { version = "0.1.0" }
```

Alternatively, add this to your `Cargo.toml` manifest to use this crate
with a specific Bitcoin Core version as the backend (v28.0 or v29.0):

```toml
# Bitcoin Core v29.0
bdk-bitcoind-client = { version = "0.1.0", default-features = false, features = ["29_0"] }

# Bitcoin Core v28.0
bdk-bitcoind-client = { version = "0.1.0", default-features = false, features = ["28_0"] }
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use bdk_bitcoind_client::{Auth, Client};
use std::path::PathBuf;
fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Define how to authenticate with `bitcoind` (Cookie File or User/Pass)
    let auth = Auth::CookieFile(PathBuf::from("/path/to/regtest/.cookie"));
    let auth = Auth::UserPass("user".to_string(), "pass".to_string());

    // Instantiate a JSON-RPC `Client`
    let client = Client::with_auth("http://127.0.0.1:18443", auth)?;

    // Perform blockchain queries to `bitcoind` using the `Client`
    let block_count = client.get_block_count()?;
    let best_hash = client.get_block_hash(block_count)?;
    let best_header = client.get_block_header_verbose(&best_hash)?;

    println!("Block Count: {}", block_count);
    println!("Best Block Hash: {}", best_hash);
    println!("Chain Tip: {} at height {}", best_header.hash, best_header.height);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Bitcoin Core Version Compatibility

Bitcoin Core often changes its JSON-RPC schema, such as the addition of the `target`
and `difficulty` fields in the `getmininginfo` RPC on Bitcoin Core v29.0 and newer.

This crate manages this via compile-time feature flags:

| Feature Flag     | Bitcoin Core Version | Notes                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `30_0` (default) | v30.x                |                                                              |
| `29_0`           | v29.x                | Supports `target` and `difficulty` fields on `getmininginfo` |
| `28_0`           | v28.x and older      | Omits newer fields                                           |


## Developing

This project uses [`cargo-rbmt`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin-maintainer-tools/tree/master/cargo-rbmt)
to manage everything related to `cargo`, such as formatting, linting, testing and CI. To install it, run:

```console
~$ cargo install cargo-rbmt
```

A `justfile` is provided for convenient command-running. You must have
[`just`](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) installed.

Run `just` to see available commands:

```console
~$ just
